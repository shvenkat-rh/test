## Overview

This system provides two automated workflows:

1. **Single Issue Analysis** (`gemini-issue-analysis.yml`)
   - Triggers when a new issue is opened
   - Analyzes the issue against your codebase
   - Provides AI-powered insights, root cause analysis, and solutions
   - Includes prompt injection security checks

2. **Bulk Issue Analysis** (`ai-bulk-issue-analysis.yml`)
   - Triggers when a PR is merged to main
   - Re-analyzes all open issues with updated codebase context
   - Posts new analysis comments with fresh insights
   - Includes prompt injection reports for all issues

### Key Features

- **Automated Analysis**: AI analyzes issues using your codebase context  
- **Security Protection**: Built-in prompt injection detection  
- **Configurable**: Customize repository, prompts, and output paths  
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies duplicate issues automatically  
- **Smart Labeling**: Auto-assigns labels based on analysis  

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. GitHub Repository

- A GitHub repository with Issues enabled
- GitHub Actions enabled in repository settings

### 2. Gemini API Key

You'll need a Google Gemini API key:

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Click **"Get API key"** or **"Create API key"**
3. Create a new API key or use an existing one
4. **Copy the API key** (you'll need it later)

> **Note**: The Gemini API has a free tier with generous limits. Check [Google's pricing page](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) for current limits.

### 3. AI-Issue-Triage Repository

This system uses the [AI-Issue-Triage](https://github.com/shvenkat-rh/AI-Issue-Triage) repository, which contains:

- `cli.py` - Main analysis CLI
- `duplicate_cli.py` - Duplicate issue detection
- `prompt_injection.py` - Security checks
- `gemini_analyzer.py` - AI analysis engine
- `models.py` - Data models

The workflows automatically clone this repository during execution - **no manual setup needed**.

---

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Copy Workflow Files

Copy these files to your repository:

```bash
.github/workflows/
├── gemini-issue-analysis.yml      # Single issue analysis
└── ai-bulk-issue-analysis.yml     # Bulk issue analysis
```

### Step 2: Create Configuration File

Create `triage.config.json` in your repository root:

```json
{
  "repository": {
    "url": "https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO",
    "description": "Target repository for AI issue analysis"
  },
  "repomix": {
    "output_path": "repomix-output.txt",
    "description": "Path where repomix output will be stored"
  },
  "analysis": {
    "custom_prompt_path": "",
    "description": "Optional: Path to custom prompt template file for AI analysis (leave empty to use default)"
  }
}
```

**Important**: Replace `YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO` with your actual GitHub organization and repository name.

### Step 3: Add Gemini API Key to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **"New repository secret"**
4. **Name**: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
5. **Value**: Paste your Gemini API key
6. Click **"Add secret"**

### Step 4: Commit and Push

```bash
git add .github/workflows/ triage.config.json
git commit -m "Add AI issue triage workflows"
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Test the Setup

Create a test issue in your repository:

1. Go to **Issues** → **New Issue**
2. Title: `Test AI Analysis`
3. Description: `This is a test issue to verify the AI analysis workflow is working correctly.`
4. Click **Create issue**

Within a few minutes, you should see:
- Workflow running in the **Actions** tab
- AI analysis comment posted on the issue
- Labels automatically added

---

## Configuration

### triage.config.json

This is your main configuration file with three sections:

#### 1. Repository Configuration

```json
"repository": {
  "url": "https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO",
  "description": "Target repository for AI issue analysis"
}
```

- **url**: The GitHub repository to analyze
- This is used by `repomix` to fetch and analyze your codebase

#### 2. Repomix Configuration

```json
"repomix": {
  "output_path": "repomix-output.txt",
  "description": "Path where repomix output will be stored"
}
```

- **output_path**: Where to store the codebase analysis file
- Default: `repomix-output.txt` (you usually don't need to change this)

#### 3. Analysis Configuration

```json
"analysis": {
  "custom_prompt_path": "",
  "description": "Optional: Path to custom prompt template file"
}
```

- **custom_prompt_path**: Path to your custom prompt template (optional)
- Leave empty (`""`) to use the default prompt. The default prompt is specific to `ansible-creator`.
- See [Custom Prompts](#custom-prompts) section below

---

## Customization

### Custom Prompts

You can customize how the AI analyzes issues by providing your own prompt template.

#### Step 1: Create a Prompt File

Create `prompt.txt` in your repository root:

```text
You are an expert software engineer analyzing a code issue for [YOUR PROJECT NAME]. 
Your task is to perform comprehensive issue analysis based on the provided codebase.

ISSUE DETAILS:
Title: {title}
Description: {issue_description}

CODEBASE CONTENT:
{codebase_content}

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Issue Classification**: Determine if this is a 'bug', 'enhancement', or 'feature_request'
2. **Severity Assessment**: Rate as 'low', 'medium', 'high', or 'critical'
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the primary cause and contributing factors
4. **Code Location Identification**: Find relevant files, functions, and classes
5. **Solution Proposal**: Suggest specific code changes with rationale

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{{
    "issue_type": "bug|enhancement|feature_request",
    "severity": "low|medium|high|critical",
    "root_cause_analysis": {{
        "primary_cause": "Main reason for the issue",
        "contributing_factors": ["factor1", "factor2"],
        "affected_components": ["component1", "component2"],
        "related_code_locations": [
            {{
                "file_path": "path/to/file.py",
                "line_number": 123,
                "function_name": "function_name",
                "class_name": "ClassName"
            }}
        ]
    }},
    "proposed_solutions": [
        {{
            "description": "Solution description",
            "code_changes": "Specific code changes needed",
            "location": {{
                "file_path": "path/to/file.py",
                "line_number": 123,
                "function_name": "function_name",
                "class_name": "ClassName"
            }},
            "rationale": "Why this solution works"
        }}
    ],
    "confidence_score": 0.85,
    "analysis_summary": "Brief summary of the analysis"
}}

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
- Focus on [YOUR PROJECT'S] specific patterns and architecture
- Consider [YOUR LANGUAGE]-specific patterns and best practices
- Look for patterns in existing code for consistency
- Provide actionable, specific solutions

Please analyze the issue and provide your response in the exact JSON format specified above.
```

#### Step 2: Available Placeholders

Your prompt **must** include these placeholders (they will be replaced automatically):

- `{title}` - The issue title
- `{issue_description}` - The issue description/body
- `{codebase_content}` - Your complete codebase from repomix

#### Step 3: Update Configuration

Update `triage.config.json`:

```json
"analysis": {
  "custom_prompt_path": "prompt.txt"
}
```

#### Step 4: Commit and Push

```bash
git add prompt.txt triage.config.json
git commit -m "Add custom analysis prompt"
git push origin main
```

### Analyzing a Different Repository

You can analyze issues from one repository using the codebase from another:

**Example**: Analyze issues in `my-org/issues-repo` using code from `my-org/main-codebase`

In `my-org/issues-repo`, set `triage.config.json`:

```json
{
  "repository": {
    "url": "https://github.com/my-org/main-codebase"
  }
}
```

This is useful for:
- Separating issue tracking from code
- Analyzing legacy code with modern tooling
- Cross-repository analysis

---

## Usage

### Single Issue Analysis

**Triggered**: When a new issue is created

**What it does**:
1. Fetches your codebase using repomix
2. Checks for prompt injection (security)
3. Checks for duplicate issues
4. Analyzes the issue with AI
5. Posts analysis comment
6. Adds relevant labels

**Labels Added**:
- `gemini-analyzed` - Issue has been analyzed
- `type:bug` / `type:enhancement` / `type:feature_request`
- `severity:low` / `severity:medium` / `severity:high` / `severity:critical`
- `duplicate` - If duplicate found
- `security-alert` - If prompt injection detected
- `prompt-injection-blocked` / `prompt-injection-warning`

### Bulk Issue Analysis

**Triggered**: When a PR is merged to main

**What it does**:
1. Re-analyzes ALL open issues
2. Posts prompt injection report for each issue
3. Posts updated AI analysis (using new codebase)
4. Updates labels based on new analysis

**Use Cases**:
- After major code refactoring
- When issue context changes
- Periodic re-analysis of open issues

---

## Advanced Configuration

### AI-Issue-Triage Repository Settings

The workflows clone from:
- **Repository**: `shvenkat-rh/AI-Issue-Triage`
- **Branch**: `updated-genai-package`

To use a fork or different branch, modify the workflow:

```yaml
- name: Clone AI-Issue-Triage repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    repository: YOUR-ORG/AI-Issue-Triage  # Change this
    ref: your-branch-name                 # Change this
    path: ai-triage
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Workflow Stuck in "Queued" State

**Cause**: GitHub Actions runner availability or resource limits

**Solutions**:
1. Wait - workflows may queue during peak times
2. Check **Settings** → **Actions** → **General** for approval requirements
3. Verify you haven't hit GitHub Actions limits
4. For private repos, check your plan's concurrent job limits

### Issue: "GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable not set"

**Cause**: API key not configured properly

**Solutions**:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` exists
3. Check the secret name is exactly `GEMINI_API_KEY` (case-sensitive)
4. If recently added, try re-running the workflow

### Issue: "Source file not found"

**Cause**: Configuration file path incorrect

**Solutions**:
1. Verify `triage.config.json` exists in repository root
2. Check the file is committed and pushed
3. Verify repository URL in config is correct
4. Check repomix can access the repository (must be public or accessible)

### Issue: Analysis Quality is Poor

**Cause**: Default prompt not optimized for your project

**Solutions**:
1. Create a custom prompt (see [Custom Prompts](#custom-prompts))
2. Include project-specific context and patterns
3. Specify your programming language and frameworks
4. Add examples of good analysis for your project

### Issue: Too Many False Positive Prompt Injections

**Cause**: Legitimate content triggering security checks

**Solutions**:
1. Review the detected patterns in workflow logs
2. Contact repository maintainers to adjust sensitivity
3. The security system errs on the side of caution
4. Low/Medium risks still get analyzed

### Viewing Workflow Logs

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on the workflow run
3. Expand each step to see detailed logs
4. Download artifacts for analysis results

### Workflow Artifacts

Both workflows upload artifacts containing:
- `analysis_result.json` - Structured analysis data
- `analysis_result.txt` - Human-readable analysis
- `prompt_injection_result.json` - Security check results
- `duplicate_result.json` - Duplicate detection results
- `triage.config.json` - Configuration used
- `repomix-output.txt` - Codebase analysis

Access artifacts:
1. Go to completed workflow run
2. Scroll to **Artifacts** section
3. Download zip files

---

## Cost Considerations

### GitHub Actions

- **Free Tier**: 2,000 minutes/month for public repositories
- **Private Repos**: Minutes depend on your plan
- These workflows typically use 5-15 minutes per run

### Gemini API

- **Free Tier**: Generous limits for development and testing
- **Costs**: Check [Google AI Pricing](https://ai.google.dev/pricing)
- **Typical Usage**: 
  - Single issue analysis: ~1-2 requests
  - Bulk analysis: 1-2 requests per open issue

### Repomix

- Free and open-source
- Runs during workflow execution
- No additional costs

---

## Security Notes

### Data Privacy

- Issue content is sent to Google's Gemini API
- Your codebase is packaged by repomix and included in prompts
- No data is stored permanently by the workflows
- All processing happens in isolated GitHub Actions runners

### Prompt Injection Protection

The system includes built-in protection against prompt injection attacks:

- **Risk Levels**: safe, low, medium, high, critical
- **High/Critical**: Issue analysis is blocked
- **Low/Medium**: Analysis proceeds with warnings
- **Safe**: Normal processing

### Recommendations

1. Review security alerts on issues
2. Keep the AI-Issue-Triage dependency updated
3. Monitor workflow logs for unusual activity
4. Rotate your Gemini API key periodically
5. Use GitHub's secret scanning features
